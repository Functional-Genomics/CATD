\title{Generate random sample with different proportion of outliers and leverage points}
\usage{
sample.sim(n, p, sig, a1, a2, nn = TRUE, intercept = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{number of observations.}

\item{p}{number of independent variables (predictors).}

\item{sig}{variance of dependent variable.}

\item{a1}{proportion of outliers.}

\item{a2}{proportion of leverage points in outliers.}

\item{nn}{whether coefficients are non-negative, default TRUE.}

\item{intercept}{whether intercept is included in model, default TRUE.}
}
\value{
y:  vector of dependent variable.

x:  matrix of predictors with n rows and p columns.

loc:  index of added outliers.

beta: vector of coefficients.
